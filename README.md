 The objective of the practice is to simulate a rectangular deformable mesh that behaves appropriately when a spherical object is dropped on it. As the mesh is not rigid, its structure must be able to deform realistically depending on the forces acting on its different parts.

There are different ways to carry out this simulation. In this practice we will simulate the mesh as a set of small masses joined together (which we will call nodes) by springs. Therefore, the mesh will be nothing more than a rectangular structure of masses and springs that
They join those masses together. Later, the possibility that different parts of the mesh could break will be added to the simulation. Finally, we will simulate the fall of a sphere onto the mesh, so that the sphere and the mesh collide properly. For the collision we will also use a spring-based model.
